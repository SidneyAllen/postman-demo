Open each request and click \"Send\" to see what happens.\n\n#### **Step 2: View responses**\n\nObserve the response tab for status code (200 OK), response time, and size.\n\n#### **Step 3: Send new Body data**\n\nUpdate or add new data in \"Body\" in the POST request. Typically, Body data is also used in PUT and PATCH requests.\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"Add your name in the body\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n#### **Step 4: Update the variable**\n\nVariables enable you to store and reuse values in Postman. We have created a variable called `base_url` with the sample request [https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me](https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me). Replace it with your API endpoint to customize this collection.\n\n#### **Step 5: Add tests in the \"Tests\" tab**\n\nTests help you confirm that your API is working as expected. You can write test scripts in JavaScript and view the output in the \"Test Results\" tab.\n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/b5f280a7-4b09-48ec-857f-0a7ed99d7ef8/U2NyZWVuc2hvdCAyMDIzLTAzLTI3IGF0IDkuNDcuMjggUE0ucG5n\">\n\n## üí™ Pro tips\n\n- Use folders to group related requests and organize the collection.\n- Add more scripts in \"Tests\" to verify if the API works as expected and execute flows.\n    \n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Resources\n\n[Building requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/)  \n[Authorizing requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/)  \n[Using variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/)  \n[Managing environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/)  \n[Writing scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/)","schema":"https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.0.0/collection.json"},"item":[{"name":"Get data","event":[{"listen":"test","script":{"id":"9622bd1d-c05b-4f42-a463-31c395ff3ed5","exec":["pm.test(\"Status code is 200\", function () {","    pm.response.to.have.status(200);","});"],"type":"text/javascript"}}],"id":"5cb932e9-8f7d-4292-b001-30c9924bee4f","protocolProfileBehavior":{"disableBodyPruning":true},"request":{"method":"GET","header":[],"url":"{{base_url}}/info/{id}","description":"This is a GET request and it is used to \"get\" data from an endpoint.
